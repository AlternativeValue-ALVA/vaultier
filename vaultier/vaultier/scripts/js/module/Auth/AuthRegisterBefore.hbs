        <h4>How our security works</h4>

        <p>
            Vaultier uses encryption algorithms to keep your data safe.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All secrets submited to vaultier are encrypted by your private key
            and can be red only by you and your team.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Because of strong security you log into the Vaultier with you email
            and private key instead of password.
